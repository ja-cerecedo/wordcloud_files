This project is a continuation of my work from project 1. For project 1, I focused on web scrapping data from the top 3 entrepreneurship journals websites to update the Entrepreneurship Research Productivity ranking started on 2018 by Texas Christian University.

The main goal of the ranking is to collect the articles, authors, and the institution they are affiliated with to then rank the institutions productivity in terms of entrepreneurship research at peer reviewed journals. 

The selection of the 3 journals on entrepreneurship is based on the Financial Times List and the journals are “Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice”, “Journal of Business Venturing: and “Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal”.

For project 2, I will use all the articles titles from the same dataset and do a text mining analysis with Shiny Word Cloud to have a clear view of what are the most common themes in each journal by analyzing each individually and in the field of entrepreneurship by analyzing all titles from the 3 journals together.

I developed the Shiny App with the option to upload any .txt file so I can use it in the future for other projects.
